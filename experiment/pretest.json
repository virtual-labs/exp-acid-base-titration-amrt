      "question": "In a titration experiment, 20mL of HCl was needed to completely neutralize 40mL of 0.10 mol/L NaOH. What was the concentration of the acid?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.080 mol/L",
        "b": "0.0080 mol/L",
        "c": "0.02 mol/L",
        "d": "0.2 mol/L"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This would require more acid than was actually used",
        "b": "This concentration is too low for the given volumes",
        "c": "This doesn't match the stoichiometry of the reaction",
        "d": "Correct: Using the formula M1V1 = M2V2, the concentration is 0.2 mol/L"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct: Acids produce hydronium ions (H3O+) in solution",
        "b": "Oxide ions are characteristic of basic oxides, not acids",
        "c": "Hydroxide ions are characteristic of bases, not acids",
